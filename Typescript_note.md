# TypeScript Learning Note

### Questions need to be solved

This section is only used for me(the author) to taking notes on questions that I come across during I learn TypeScript.

- Try out several kinds of inheritance/implementation patterns with:
  - Class extends class; How to do it? What's the practical usecase, if any;  
  - Class implement interface;
  - Interface extends interface;
  - Interface extends more than one interfaces;
  - Interface extends from class;
  - Experiment: Can we do multiple inheritance in TypeScript? If so, how to do and when is it applicable?
  - Experiment: Interface extends from a class. And what's the use of the interface?

## Initialize a TypeScript project

We can follow the steps listed below to initialize a TypeScript project.

1. Go to the project folder, for example, `D:\mytsprj`.

```shell
> cd d:\mytsprj
d:\mytsprj\>
```

2. In the project folder, execute the following command.

```shell
d:\mytsprj\> npx tsc --init

Created a new tsconfig.json with:

  target: es2016
  module: commonjs
  strict: true
  esModuleInterop: true
  skipLibCheck: true
  forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true
